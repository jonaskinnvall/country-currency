# Country-Currency

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/65f98bb3-27f5-49f2-822e-851bfc09c744/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/country-currency/deploys)

## Frontend

This site is developed in React, bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) and mostly uses Flexbox to handle layout

## Libraries

For the graph visualization I use [Recharts](http://recharts.org/en-US/) and [Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/index.html) to manage the dates for the graph

## APIs

To fetch info about countries I use [restcountries.eu](restcountries.eu) and after that [exchangerate.host](exchangerate.host) to get the relevant currency rates and time-series data
